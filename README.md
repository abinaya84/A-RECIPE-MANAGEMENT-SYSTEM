# A-RECIPE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This Recipe Management System in Java allows users to view and explore different recipes categorized into groups such as **Veg**, **Non-Veg**, and **Sweets**. The system consists of three main classes: the **Recipe** class, which stores a recipeâ€™s name and detailed instructions; the **RecipeCategory** class, which organizes recipes into categories and allows adding and displaying recipes; and the **RecipeManagementSystem** class, which serves as the main control system, providing an interactive menu for users to browse categories and view recipes. The program initializes a set of predefined categories and recipes with their respective instructions, and the user can select a category, view its recipes, and select a recipe to display its detailed preparation steps. The system is designed for command-line interaction, allowing the user to choose actions like viewing recipes or exiting the program. While it provides a basic structure for managing recipes, it can be expanded with features such as adding, editing, or deleting recipes, or even implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.
